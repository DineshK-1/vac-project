    <h3>About HTML</h3>

    <b>Full form : Hypertext Markup Language.</b>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    i) HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. <br>
    ii) HTML describes the structure of a Web page.<br>
    iii) HTML consists of a series of elements.<br>
    iv) HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.<br>
    v) HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link",
    etc.<br>

    <h3>Use of HTML:</h3>
    i) Web pages development :
    HTML is heavily used for creating pages that are displayed on the world wide web.
    Every page contains a set of HTML tags, including hyperlinks which are used for connecting to other pages.
    <br>
    ii) Web document Creation :
    Document creation on the internet is dominated by HTML and its basic concept via tag and DOM, i.e. document object
    model.
    HTML tags are inserted before and afterwards or phrases to locate their format and location on the page.
    A web document consists of three sections: title, head, and body.
    <br>
    iii) Internet navigation :
    This is one of the most important uses of HTML, which is revolutionary.
    This navigation is possible by utilizing the concept of Hypertext.
    It is basically a text which refers to other web pages or text, and when the user clicks on it, would navigate to
    referenced text or page.
    HTML is heavily used to embed the hyperlink within the web pages.
    A user can easily navigate the web pages and between websites as well, located on different servers.
    <br>
    iv) Cutting edge feature :
    HTML5, with its set of standards and API, is being used to introduce some of the latest trends in the website
    creation business.
    Like polyfill libraries, which are supported by old browsers equally well.
    Browser like Google Chrome is the perfect choice when it comes to implementing an HTML5 latest set of standards.
    <br>
    v) Responsive images on web pages :
    At the elementary level in applications of HTML, queries can be set to utilize the images, which are responsive in
    nature.
    With the srcset attribute of img element in HTML and combining it with picture elements, a developer can fully
    control how the user will render an image.
    Now different types of an image with size variation can be loaded by using the img element.
    <br>
    vi) Client-side storage :
    Earlier, a user could not save the user’s browser data that would persist across sessions.
    To meet this requirement, server-side infrastructure has to be built, or user’s cookies can be used.
    <br>
    vii) Offline capabilities usage :
    Once data can be stored in the browser, the developer can think of a strategy to make the application work when a
    user is disconnected.
    HTML5 has its application cache mechanism, which would define how the browser manages the offline situation.
    <br>
    viii) Data Entry support with HTML :
    HTML5 standard and set of APIs can be used to support data entry level of work.
    As browsers implement new HTML5 standards, developers can simply add the tags to the tag, indicating required
    fields, text, data format, etc.
    <br>

    <h3>Conclusion :</h3>

    HTML is more complicated with its latest set of elements and a large set of APIs.
    Anyone who can grasp the basic concept is to a good start.
    Gone are the days when HTML was synonymous with the usage of a certain set of elements, tags, and their attributes.
    With HTML5, a developer has a lot of potential good tools and APIs in their arsenal, which can make its contemporary
    technologies lag behind.
    Usage in HTML is wide-spread and has become more sophisticated than ever before.
    It’s the developer’s ability to put applications of HTML concept in real-time usage.
